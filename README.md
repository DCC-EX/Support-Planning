# Support-Planning

This repository is to capture all relevant documentation, processes, and workflows related to the DCC++ EX project.

The goal of this repository is to enable consistent processes and workflows to track and visualise the various activities being undertaken as part of the project, without inhibiting creativity.

Automation and integrations are the preferred options where possible, with human interaction limited to adding/updating labels and information where required.

This includes:
- Support processes
- GitHub Project configuration
- GitHub Workflows required for each repository
- Standard GitHub labels
- Integrations
- Required labels/metadata for issues and pull requests
