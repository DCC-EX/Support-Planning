# Support Planning

This repository is to capture all relevant documentation, processes, and workflows related to the DCC-EX project.

The documentation is captured in the [Support Planning Wiki](https://github.com/DCC-EX/Support-Planning/wiki) and outlines the purpose of the various issue templates, workflows, processes, and testing information.

# Issue template and workflow file locations

All files in the "Issue_Templates" folder need to reside in the https://github.com/DCC-EX/.github repository in the ".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/" folder.

The "build-text.yml" workflow must reside in the ".github/workflows/" folder in every repository requiring a build test to be performed when code is pushed and PRs are merged.

The "new-items.yml" workflow must reside in the ".github/workflows/" folder in every public repository across the entire DCC-EX GitHub organisation.
